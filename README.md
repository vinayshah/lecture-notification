# Lecture Notification
The Lecture Notification is an Android Based Application which was developed to provide a platform for lectures to easily communicate with their students. This application focuses on reducing the communication cost by implementation of Android GCM services. It can send notification over the network, to the fellow students about their corresponding lectures and timetable. This will be updated by the admin panel dynamically.
